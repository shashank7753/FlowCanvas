## Usage

### Adding Components

To add a new component, create a file in the `src/components/` directory. Use TypeScript to define props and ensure type safety.

### Diagramming with React Flow

React Flow is integrated to handle dynamic diagrams and workflows. Refer to the [React Flow documentation](https://reactflow.dev/docs/) for advanced usage.
